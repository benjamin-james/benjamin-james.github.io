	abstract = {GENCODE produces high quality gene and transcript annotation for the human and mouse genomes. All GENCODE annotation is supported by experimental data and serves as a reference for genome biology and clinical genomics. The GENCODE consortium generates targeted experimental data, develops bioinformatic tools and carries out analyses that, along with externally produced data and methods, support the identification and annotation of transcript structures and the determination of their function. Here, we present an update on the annotation of human and mouse genes, including developments in the tools, data, analyses and major collaborations which underpin this progress. For example, we report the creation of a set of non-canonical ORFs identified in GENCODE transcripts, the LRGASP collaboration to assess the use of long transcriptomic data to build transcript models, the progress in collaborations with RefSeq and UniProt to increase convergence in the annotation of human and mouse protein-coding genes, the propagation of GENCODE across the human pan-genome and the development of new tools to support annotation of regulatory features by GENCODE. Our annotation is accessible via Ensembl, the UCSC Genome Browser and https://www.gencodegenes.org.},

We used this resource to annotate 20,000 genetic loci that were associated with 232 traits4, predicting trait-relevant tissues, putative causal nucleotide variants in enriched tissue enhancers and candidate tissue-specific target genes for each. We partitioned multifactorial traits into tissue-specific contributing factors with distinct functional enrichments and disease comorbidity patterns, and revealed both single-factor monotropic and multifactor pleiotropic loci. Top-scoring loci frequently had multiple predicted driver variants, converging through multiple enhancers with a common target gene, multiple genes in common tissues, or multiple genes and multiple tissues, indicating extensive pleiotropy. Our results demonstrate the importance of dense, rich, high-resolution epigenomic annotations for the investigation of complex traits.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, but the cellular pathways that underlie its pathological progression across brain regions remain poorly understood1–3. Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of six different brain regions in the aged human brain, covering 1.3 million cells from 283 post-mortem human brain samples across 48 individuals with and without Alzheimer’s disease. We identify 76 cell types, including region-specific subtypes of astrocytes and excitatory neurons and an inhibitory interneuron population unique to the thalamus and distinct from canonical inhibitory subclasses. We identify vulnerable populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are depleted in specific brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease, and provide evidence that the Reelin signalling pathway is involved in modulating the vulnerability of these neurons. We develop a scalable method for discovering gene modules, which we use to identify cell-type-specific and region-specific modules that are altered in Alzheimer’s disease and to annotate transcriptomic differences associated with diverse pathological variables. We identify an astrocyte program that is associated with cognitive resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology, tying choline metabolism and polyamine biosynthesis in astrocytes to preserved cognitive function late in life. Together, our study develops a regional atlas of the ageing human brain and provides insights into cellular vulnerability, response and resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology.},

Entering its twentieth year, the project remains highly active as new technologies and methodologies allow us to catalog the genome at ever-increasing granularity.

Meanwhile, we are incorporating data from state-of-the-art proteomics and Ribo-seq experiments to fine-tune our annotation of translated sequences, while further insights into function can be gained from multi-genome alignments that grow richer as more species’ genomes are sequenced. Such methodologies are combined into a fully integrated annotation workflow. However, the increasing complexity of our resources can present usability challenges, and we are resolving these with the creation of filtered genesets such as MANE Select and GENCODE Primary. The next challenge is to propagate annotations throughout multiple human and mouse genomes, as we enter the pangenome era.

	abstract = {Sequence clustering is a fundamental step in analyzing DNA sequences. Widely-used software tools for sequence clustering utilize greedy approaches that are not guaranteed to produce the best results. These tools are sensitive to one parameter that determines the similarity among sequences in a cluster. Often times, a biologist may not know the exact sequence similarity. Therefore, clusters produced by these tools do not likely match the real clusters comprising the data if the provided parameter is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the mean shift algorithm, an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, which has been used successfully thousands of times in fields such as image processing and computer vision. The theory behind the mean shift algorithm, unlike the greedy approaches, guarantees convergence to the modes, e.g. cluster centers. Here we describe the first application of the mean shift algorithm to clustering DNA sequences. MeShClust is one of few applications of the mean shift algorithm in bioinformatics. Further, we applied supervised machine learning to predict the identity score produced by global alignment using alignment-free methods. We demonstrate MeShClust’s ability to cluster DNA sequences with high accuracy even when the sequence similarity parameter provided by the user is not very accurate.},

	abstract = {Identifying transcriptional enhancers and their target genes is essential for understanding gene regulation and the impact of human genetic variation on disease1–6. Here we create and evaluate a resource of {\textgreater}13 million enhancer-gene regulatory interactions across 352 cell types and tissues, by integrating predictive models, measurements of chromatin state and 3D contacts, and large-scale genetic perturbations generated by the ENCODE Consortium7. We first create a systematic benchmarking pipeline to compare predictive models, assembling a dataset of 10,411 element-gene pairs measured in CRISPR perturbation experiments, {\textgreater}30,000 fine-mapped eQTLs, and 569 fine-mapped GWAS variants linked to a likely causal gene. Using this framework, we develop a new predictive model, ENCODE-rE2G, that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple prediction tasks, demonstrating a strategy involving iterative perturbations and supervised machine learning to build increasingly accurate predictive models of enhancer regulation. Using the ENCODE-rE2G model, we build an encyclopedia of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in the human genome, which reveals global properties of enhancer networks, identifies differences in the functions of genes that have more or less complex regulatory landscapes, and improves analyses to link noncoding variants to target genes and cell types for common, complex diseases. By interpreting the model, we find evidence that, beyond enhancer activity and 3D enhancer-promoter contacts, additional features guide enhancer-promoter communication including promoter class and enhancer-enhancer synergy. Altogether, these genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, benchmarking software, predictive models, and insights about enhancer function provide a valuable resource for future studies of gene regulation and human genetics.},

	abstract = {Since the dawn of the bioinformatics field, sequence alignment scores have been the main method for comparing sequences. However, alignment algorithms are quadratic, requiring long execution time. As alternatives, scientists have developed tens of alignment-free statistics for measuring the similarity between two sequences. We surveyed tens of alignment-free k-mer statistics. Additionally, we evaluated 33 statistics and multiplicative combinations between the statistics and/or their squares. These statistics are calculated on two k-mer histograms representing two sequences. Our evaluations using global alignment scores revealed that the majority of the statistics are sensitive and capable of finding similar sequences to a query sequence. Therefore, any of these statistics can filter out dissimilar sequences quickly. Further, we observed that multiplicative combinations of the statistics are highly correlated with the identity score. Furthermore, combinations involving sequence length difference or Earth Mover’s distance, which takes the length difference into account, are always among the highest correlated paired statistics with identity scores. Similarly, paired statistics including length difference or Earth Mover’s distance are among the best performers in finding the K-closest sequences. Interestingly, similar performance can be obtained using histograms of shorter words, resulting in reducing the memory requirement and increasing the speed remarkably. Moreover, we found that simple single statistics are sufficient for processing next-generation sequencing reads and for applications relying on local alignment. Finally, we measured the time requirement of each statistic. The survey and the evaluations will help scientists with identifying efficient alternatives to the costly alignment algorithm, saving thousands of computational hours. The source code of the benchmarking tool is available as Supplementary Materials.},

	abstract = {Patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy frequently experience a neurological condition known as chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment, or “chemobrain,” which can persist for the remainder of their lives. Despite the growing prevalence of chemobrain, both its underlying mechanisms and treatment strategies remain poorly understood. Recent findings suggest that chemobrain shares several characteristics with neurodegenerative diseases, including chronic neuroinflammation, DNA damage, and synaptic loss. We investigated whether a noninvasive sensory stimulation treatment we term gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (GENUS), which has been shown to alleviate aberrant immune and synaptic pathologies in mouse models of neurodegeneration, could also mitigate chemobrain phenotypes in mice administered a chemotherapeutic drug. When administered concurrently with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, GENUS alleviated cisplatin-induced brain pathology, promoted oligodendrocyte survival, and improved cognitive function in a mouse model of chemobrain. These effects persisted for up to 105 days after GENUS treatment, suggesting the potential for long-lasting benefits. However, when administered to mice 90 days after chemotherapy, GENUS treatment only provided limited benefits, indicating that it was most effective when used to prevent the progression of chemobrain pathology. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effects of GENUS in mice were not limited to cisplatin-induced chemobrain but also extended to methotrexate-induced chemobrain. Collectively, these findings suggest that GENUS may represent a versatile approach for treating chemobrain induced by different chemotherapy agents.},

	abstract = {Pairwise global alignment is a fundamental step in sequence analysis. Optimal alignment algorithms are quadratic—slow especially on long sequences. In many applications that involve large sequence datasets, all what is needed is calculating the identity scores (percentage of identical nucleotides in an optimal alignment—including gaps—of two sequences); there is no need for visualizing how every two sequences are aligned. For these applications, we propose Identity, which produces global identity scores for a large number of pairs of DNA sequences using alignment-free methods and self-supervised general linear models. For the first time, the new tool can predict pairwise identity scores in linear time and space. On two large-scale sequence databases, Identity provided the best compromise between sensitivity and precision while being faster than BLAST, Mash, MUMmer4 and USEARCH by 2–80 times. Identity was the best performing tool when searching for low-identity matches. While constructing phylogenetic trees from about 6000 transcripts, the tree due to the scores reported by Identity was the closest to the reference tree (in contrast to andi, FSWM and Mash). Identity is capable of producing pairwise identity scores of millions-of-nucleotides-long bacterial genomes; this task cannot be accomplished by any global-alignment-based tool.

To construct a human cell-based model that includes these features and all six major brain cell types needed to mimic disease and dissect pathological mechanisms, we have constructed, characterized, and utilized a multicellular integrated brain (miBrain) immuno-glial-neurovascular model by engineering a brain-inspired 3D hydrogel and identifying conditions to coculture these six brain cell types, all differentiated from patient induced pluripotent stem cells. miBrains recapitulate in vivo–like hallmarks inclusive of neuronal activity, functional connectivity, barrier function, myelin-producing oligodendrocyte engagement with neurons, multicellular interactions, and transcriptomic profiles. We implemented the model to study Alzheimer’s Disease pathologies associated with APOE4 genetic risk. APOE4 miBrains differentially exhibit amyloid aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein. Unlike the coemergent fate specification of glia and neurons in other organoid approaches, miBrains integrate independently differentiated cell types, a feature we harnessed to identify that APOE4 in astrocytes promotes neuronal tau pathogenesis and dysregulation through crosstalk with microglia.},

The current available tools are either sensitive or specific but not both; some tools require adjusting parameters manually.We propose Look4TRs, the first application of self-supervised hidden Markov models to discovering microsatellites. Look4TRs adapts itself to the input genomes, balancing high sensitivity and low false positive rate. It auto-calibrates itself. We evaluated Look4TRs on 26 eukaryotic genomes. Based on F measure, which combines sensitivity and false positive rate, Look4TRs outperformed TRF and MISA—the most widely used tools—by 78 and 84\%. Look4TRs outperformed the second and the third best tools, MsDetector and Tantan, by 17 and 34\%.

In contrast, MeShClust2 generates semi-synthetic sequence pairs with known mutation rates, avoiding alignment algorithms.

	abstract = {White adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction contributes to obesity-associated metabolic disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Rodent studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves WAT function, but molecular studies investigating exercise training effects on WAT in humans have been limited, particularly in the context of metabolic disease. Here, we defined the subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) transcriptome in middle-aged adults (10 male, 19 female) that were classified by lower BMI ({\textless}27 kg/m2), higher BMI (≥27 kg/m2), and T2D status before and after a 10-week endurance exercise regimen. At baseline, 624 genes were significantly upregulated and 112 genes downregulated in the scWAT from higher BMI participants compared to lower BMI. There was a spectrum of pathway dysregulation in scWAT in higher BMI individuals, ranging from increased markers of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and inflammation to decreased circadian rhythm gene expression. In people with T2D, there were additional transcriptomic differences such as translation-related pathways, selenoamino acid metabolism, and proteoglycans. Exercise training had robust effects on the transcriptome regardless of metabolic status, and notably, for the high BMI and T2D groups, training reversed several of the detrimental gene expression patterns in a cell-type-specific manner. These beneficial exercise-induced transcriptomic adaptations significantly correlated with lower levels of free fatty acids and blood pressure, particularly in participants with higher BMI and T2D. By integrating our exercise training-modulated genes with GWAS meta-analysis of physical activity, genes influenced by exercise training in the higher BMI group showed a significant enrichment in genetic associations of exercise traits in the population. A circadian rhythm-related transcription factor NR1D1 was enriched in enhancers linked with both the exercise differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and GWAS signals, suggesting a link between the circadian rhythm and training-induced adaptations. These findings demonstrate that obesity and T2D result in marked, progressive alterations in cell-type specific gene transcription in scWAT, while endurance exercise training reverses many of the metabolic disease-associated adaptations. Identification of novel molecular pathways regulated by exercise training can lead to therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic disease.},

	abstract = {Single-cell sequencing has catalyzed a significant shift in biological modeling and hypothesis generation. In this study, we present advanced algorithms that utilize multiple modalities for peak-gene linking via correlation-based mechanisms. This approach provides a robust framework for bias correction and noise reduction at single-cell resolution.
Our research introduces a novel algorithm that employs peak-gene linking to integrate epigenomic data, thereby translating it into transcriptomic data. This integration facilitates comprehensive secondary analyses on meta-cells and sub-cell types. Crucially, our methodology enables swift computation of modules from any single-cell assay, promoting exploration of intricate biological and disease mechanisms that might remain unmodeled with a pseudo-bulk approach.
By combining snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data, our method substantially outperforms equivalent tasks of gene expression estimation, showing promising results even with unpaired real data. Furthermore, the modeling of genomic peak modules using our algorithms uncovers additional signal potentially overlooked when examining single peaks.
We envision correlation-based linking as a key aspect of future single-cell multiomic technology, as it allows for correlation between assays at the single-UMI level. As such, improved modeling of data at the single-cell level will enhance our understanding of complex gene regulatory networks and disease mechanisms.},
