I am a graduate student at [[https://www.csail.mit.edu/][MIT CSAIL]] performing research in computational biology in [[https://compbio.mit.edu][Manolis Kellis's lab]],
where I study computational genomics using techniques such as single-cell and spatial omics to understand the gene regulatory landscape of human disease.
I am completing my Ph.D in [[https://www.eecs.mit.edu][EECS]] in the near future! You can find my cv [[./assets/benjamin_james_cv.pdf][here]]


Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Tulsa,
where I wrote efficient methods for alignment-free k-mer based methods for sequence homology under [[https://www.tamuk.edu/engineering/departments/eecs/faculty-and-staff/Hani-Zakaria-Girgis.html][Hani Girgis]],
and where I graduated with Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and a Frederick (1953) and Barbara Cronin Fellow.
